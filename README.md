# Python-Based-Molecular-Bioactivity-Target-Prediction-Engine
BioLead-Optimizer is a high-impact Python project designed to automate the early stages of drug discovery. By analyzing the relationship between molecular structures and biological activity, this tool helps researchers prioritize compounds that have the highest probability of successfully binding to a disease target
Key Functional Modules (All Python-Based):Molecular Data Parsing: Efficiently processing large-scale .csv and .sdf datasets containing chemical information.Feature Engineering (Fingerprinting): Converting chemical SMILES strings into numerical vectors (Morgan Fingerprints) for machine learning compatibility.Bioactivity Regression Model: A Scikit-Learn based ensemble model to predict $pIC_{50}$ values (the standard measure of drug potency).Virtual Screening Pipeline: An automated script to "screen" thousands of molecules against a specific protein target to find the "Top 10" lead candidates.Data Visualization: Custom Plotly and Matplotlib dashboards to visualize Chemical Space (PCA/t-SNE) and Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR).Core Python Libraries Used:Pandas & NumPy: For high-performance data manipulation.Scikit-Learn: For predictive modeling and statistical validation.Matplotlib/Seaborn: For biological data visualization.RDKit (Python Library): The industry-standard library for handling chemical structures and molecular descriptors.
